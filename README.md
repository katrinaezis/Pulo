# Peer.io
Peer.io is a peer to peer collaboration tool which connects high school students with other students to give and get homework help. Features of Peer.io include integration with schools and courses allowing for open discussion boards and video tutoring sessions. Throughout capstone, our project has evolved from a simple whiteboard solution (not conducive for keyboard/mouse interaction) to a collaboration tool supporting messaging and video. The biggest technical decision we made was to split classes into open channels (discussions specific to topic) and the integration of Google Hangouts. Conceptually this is a simple solution, however implementation using Firebase and Google API proved to be somewhat challenging. The technical decision to change the backend of our application ultimately made our product function seamlessly and properly for our user. 
For our website, we chose to use Google stack which includes Firebase, jQuery and Material Design. We chose to go this route as our team was familiar with the implementation and manipulation of these tools. Firebase was essential for storing discussion board information and posts.
